### Description
Simple application testing out React using Reddit Search API and passing data from parent to child through props. 

To use the application, type in the Reddit subreddit name and the number of results you'd like to see. If that subreddit exists, a list of the top topics should appear. If that subreddit does not exist, the input fields should turn red.
