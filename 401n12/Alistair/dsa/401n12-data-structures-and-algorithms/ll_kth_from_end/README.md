[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Alwynblake/401n12-data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Alwynblake/401n12-data-structures-and-algorithms)

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
create a method that accepts a singly link list
iterate through the link list with a current node
Each node should contain "value" -> "next"

The BigO is O(n)
