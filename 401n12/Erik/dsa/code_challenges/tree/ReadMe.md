# Trees

This lab is about learning Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees. How to traverse Binary Trees with
PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder. With Binary Search Trees, we are learning how to attach nodes
in the right order and how to find those nodes. 

## Challenge

## Binary Trees
We are looking to traverse a binary tree through the following methods: PreOrder, InOrder, & PostOrder.

## Binary Search Trees
We want to successfully add nodes in the correct order (if value is larger than root, make it a right child node etc.).
We also want to be able to see if a tree contains that node.


## Approach & Efficiency

### Binary rees
For these methods, I want to use recursive since I need to go into two directions with the tree.

### Binary Search Trees

I want to be able to loop through the tree to systematically reduce my search until it either finds the node or does not.


## API

### Binary rees
* PreOrder -> traverse through the tree by Root, Left, Right.
* InOrder -> traverse through the tree by Left, Root, Right.
* PostOrder -> traverse through the tree by Left, Right, Root.

### Binary Search Trees
* Add -> Adds a node to the tree, based on the value it will be either at the right or left of a node.
* Contains -> this finds a node your are looking for in a tree. It will either return a prompt saying the value is in the tree or 
 a prompt saying we don't have it.
