# Hashtables

## Challenge

The challenge is to create a basic hashtable class and methods

## Approach & Efficiency

I wanted to create a class with methods, the point of a hash table is to have a Big O of O(1)

## API

`hash(key)` - to create a unique key
`add(key, val)` - to add a new key/value
`contain(key)` - find if a key exists
`get(key)` - returns values of a key
