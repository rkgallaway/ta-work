# Binary Trees

This lab is about traversing a binary tree through breadth.

## Challenge

The challenge is to be able to traverse the tree from left to right from the top level to the bottom

## Approach & Efficiency

I want to create a queue that is an array to act like a real queue. use .shift() to pop off the first array and add it
to the output, then see if it has children. If yes, add those children to the que and continue with the process till there
are no more nodes left.
