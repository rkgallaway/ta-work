# Breadth-first
There are two basics way yto travers over a binary tree. In this exercise we are tasked to preform a bredth first traversal

## Challenge
This challenge involves returning all the node values from the top down.  

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach to this code challenge was to use a queue to set up adding more elements to the queue and outputing the elements in order

## Solution
This works by each node adding its children to the queue.  This will ensure that all nodes in each level are added to the que before the next level begins to be output.
