# Trees
intorductory code challenge on creating binary trees

## Challenge
coding pre, in , and post Depth first traversals

## Approach & Efficiency
chose to do this recursivly, also chose to employ a helper funtion so the only thing you have to call is the method on the tree examples in the next section

## API

call binaryTreeName.pre/in/postorder(); to return an array of that trees values in the specified order

BSTs
create a BST with new BST() accepts either no input or number as root value
call bstName.insertNode(num); to insert a noide according to BST rules
