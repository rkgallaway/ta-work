            <h4>Siblings Story</h4>
        
            <p class ="padding"><img src="img\brothers.jpg">I come from a really big family! I have four sister and two brothers. My oldest brother, James, was put up for <a href="https://www.adopted.com/find-birth-parents.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwv6blBRBzEiwAihbM-Zd6HgDl__VjURfGb8l6hKrm79PPzYxEEtG3zQLB8LqkuOaEfItQehoCEPoQAvD_BwE">adoption</a> by my dad and his ex wife back in 1967. I grew up knowing about his existence and watching my parents search for him. Before the internet was as vast as it is now, it was really hard to locate missing family. May of 2017 I was searching through adoption registries and actually came across a profile of a man named James who had the same birthdate as my missing brother. I searched facebook for James and found a man living a few hours away who held a striking resemblance to my dad. I contacted him via facebook, sent him over a DNA test and, after a 99.9% DNA match, he drove his family up to meet us all for the first time in June. </p>
       
            <h4>About Bruce the pitbull</h4>
      
            <p class="padding"><img src="img\bruce.jpg">On June 16th, 2005 a friend of mine called me and told me that their dog's litter of <a href="http://love-a-bull.org/resources/the-history-of-pit-bulls/">pitbull</a> puppies had just been born and invited me over to meet the puppies. That's when I first laid eyes on Bruce. It was love at first sight. Bruce came home to live with me about 7 weeks later. He has been my companion through thick and thin since then. He is affectionate, loyal, stubborn and beautiful. He has outlived all of his siblings and is going strong! He tore his ACL in 2010 and had to get a metal implant in his knee, but besides that he's as spry as ever. His number one motivator in life is to be close to me. If he could live in my pocket he absolutely would. He is the best and he sleeps by my side every night. My next tattoo will be dedicated to that lucky guy.</p>
        
            <h4>Growing up in the 425</h4>
        
            <p> <img src="img\seattle.jpg">I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington">Redmond</a>, Washington. Now when people hear that they think of Microsoft. But it wasn't quite the mecca of technology in the 80's. Growing up there it was a lot of forest lands and farms. It was the bicycle capital of the Northwest and as far as I can remember, I'm pretty certain that the Nintendo quarters opened up there before Bill Gates staked out the land. When I was in 2nd grade we packed our bas and moved one city over to Kirkland, which is known for being the city the Costco started in. Over the 80's, 90's and 00's, I watched Microsoft take over a lot of the land their and saw my little farm hometown turn into the mecca for modern technology.</p>

            <h4>My love hate relationship with cruises</h4>
      
            <p class="padding"><img src="img\cruise.jpg">I know a lot of people love going on <a href = "https://www.carnival.com/cruise-to/alaska-cruises.aspx">cruises</a>. My best friend is a cruise addict, usually going on 2-3 cruises per year with her family. I get it, I guess. People like being out on the water and all the entertainment and it's hard for anyone to abduct your children. Ok, great. That being said, I spent the last 8 years serving people getting off of their damn alaska cruise ships in Seattle in the summer. That crowed has never appealed to me as the kind of group I'd like to be stuck on an ocean with. However, they have contributed greatly to my income over the years. I think that this may be an introvert/extravert thing, also. I'm an introvert and I'm not interested in making new friends while I'm on vacation. I'd rather go somewhere far , maybe somewhere with people who  mostly don't even speak any english, and experience a new culture and feel like I'm really disconnected from the society that I just left behind.</p>
        
            <h4 >Lotto</h4>
       
            <p> <img src="img\lotto.jpg">Ok, I honestly don't play the <a href ="https://www.walottery.com/">lotto</a> very often. The most I've ever won from a lotto ticket was $50. I do love other forms of gambling though. I like to stick wit the classics. Texas hold 'em and black jack are right up my alley! I also can't resist a good sports bet. Fantasy football, march madness, you name it!</p>

            <h4>Tattoos</h4>

            <p class = "padding"> <img src="img\tat.png">I come from a long line of people with tattoos! I got my first one when I was 23. It is my daughters footprint. From there I just kept adding! My largest piece is a lady under a willow tree taking up a large portion of my back. I get almost all of my work done by Mike at <a href="http://www.jacksonstreettattoocompany.com/">Jackson Street Tattoo.</a></p>
        
            <h4>A list of pets</h4>

            <p id="pets"><img id="bird" src="img\pigeon.jpg">Growing up my Dad made a habit of rescuing <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/how-find-wildlife-rehabilitator">injured animals,</a> nursing them back to helath and then releasing them back into the wild. He mostly brought home injured birds. We had two different crows for a short time, both named "roofus". He also brought home and rescued many pigeons. one, named piggy, was really young when we brought her home. She ended up bonding to my mom and refusing to leave when we tried to let her go. She would go outside with us and play, flying around for a while then purching on our heads or shoulders when she felt like being social. We brought her inside at night to keep her safe. She was attacked two different times by hawks, being a little spoiled she was a plump little piece of prey.</p>
