		<h1>About Me:  Ryan Gallaway</h1> 
		
    <h2>Life</h2> 
    <p>I was born in Wenatchee, Washington;  grew up in Eastern Washington; and moved to Seattle in April of 1999. 
    I currently live in the central Beacon Hill neighborhood. I have been adopted by a 19 year old dachsund-chihuahua mix; her name is Wiener. Wiener The Dog.  Mt garden is my happy place. I grow plants handed down as starts or seeds from my great grandmother to my grandmother to my mother to me.  I enjoy canning my produce and am especially proud of my pickles, applesauce, and apple butter -like my great grandmother used to make!</p>
